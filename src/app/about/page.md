## About Us ...

We are Hannah and Stephanie, interior designers based in the Surrey Hills.

At ALLO Interiors, we believe your home should feel like you.  That’s why we take a holistic approach to interior design, which goes beyond aesthetics.

We consider the psychology of your home; your influences, possessions, memories, needs, functions, and even restrictions. All these detail plays a role in shaping a space that supports how you live and how you feel. 

We want your design to:
-	spark joy
-	Spaces with rhythm and flow.
-	never trend-led, always you!
  
If you’re feeling overwhelmed or don’t know where to start? From time and budget limitations to colour choices and spatial challenges, we can help you.

We can support you at any stage of the process, whether you need guidance on one element or full interior design, from concept to completion.  

We work closely with a trusted network of architects, builders, and skilled trades, from plumbers and electricians to decorators.
