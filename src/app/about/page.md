## About Us ...

We are Hannah and Stephanie, interior designers based in the Surrey Hills, who want to inspire others with our love for elevating our everyday spaces
 
Between us we have completed various interior design courses, attended RIBA seminars and shadowed other interior designers.  However, it is our years of experience that have driven us to create "allo interiors". We have designed and styled pub interiors, staged homes to sell and completed projects for friends and family. We take pride in transforming the ordinary into something beautiful; upcycling Facebook marketplace finds, upholstering furniture and creating spectacular interiors to suit every family function.
 
Our passion and purpose is to bring our services to everyone. We have designed packages to suit everyone's budget and need, so designer interiors can be achievable for anyone who wants a life less ordinary!
