#### Create static from Canva-downloaded pngs

```
please help me slice a set of website design graphic designs into a static website

The landing page with the horizontal nav is in this file:

`/home/jon/code/project-presence/allo-interior-design/design/a life less ordinary/1.png`

the output should be html and css. The css should not be inline

Do not limit the output to a certain width and height and instead, make suggestions about how to make the design responsive to desktop and mobile screen sizes with media queries.
